German balance of payments in 2022 
In 2022, the German economy’s current account surplus decreased by 3½ percentage points to  4¼% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This represents the largest decline since German  reunification and the lowest figure for the balance since 2003. The main driver of this was the  considerable decline in the surplus on the goods account, which was a result of the massive  deterioration in the terms of trade. This was caused by the sharp rises in the prices of energy and  other imported commodities. The German services account likewise deteriorated. Here, a contri 
bution was made by cross-border travel expenditure, which rose back to its level from before the  COVID-19 pandemic. The balance of primary and secondary income remained more or less  unchanged. Aggregate net lending/net borrowing fell relative to GDP, as there was a sharp reduc tion in aggregate savings. The reason for this was the decline in the saving ratios of households  and non-financial corporations, which had risen during the pandemic. The general government  deficit decreased somewhat. On the one hand, many of the fiscal measures related to the COVID 19 pandemic came to an end. On the other hand, however, extensive new support measures  were introduced in response to the energy crisis and high inflation. 
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine as well as the high rates of inflation and the monet ary policy response to inflation were also reflected in Germany’s capital flows with other coun tries. In the financial markets, the more difficult environment led to lower turnover and a greater  desire for safety amongst investors. All in all, Germany’s net external assets rose by €220 billion  last year resulting from transactions. 
Significant changes were observed, above all, in German portfolio investment. Cross-border  demand for shares and mutual fund shares declined markedly in both directions. In net terms,  German investors sold off foreign shares and non-residents also parted with German shares. By  contrast, bonds again attracted greater mutual interest. In addition to lower risk, higher yields are  likely to have played a role here. Tighter monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic had a  major impact on these developments. For example, the Eurosystem discontinued net purchases  under its asset purchase programmes, which had a direct impact on German portfolio transac 
tions. 
Last year, it was confirmed once again that direct investment does not respond to burdens as  quickly as portfolio investment. Cross-border exposures involving German investors were remark ably robust in this segment. By contrast, the other investment account partly reflected the major  changes in securities: the considerable decline in new investment in securities was offset to a not  insignificant degree by higher net claims on non-residents.

turbulent global environment. The high rates of  inflation and tighter monetary policy in many  regions, the Russian war of aggression against  Ukraine, and some persistent effects of the  COVID-19 pandemic all weighed on global eco 
nomic developments. Developments in global  trade were rather muted, owing especially to  the weak contributions from emerging market  economies. Furthermore, in Germany, the rise  in energy prices was comparatively sharp. The  prices of imports to Germany increased due, in  particular, to the relatively strong depreciation

Surplus position  in decline, espe cially vis-à-vis  non-euro area  countries 
foreign trade balance was therefore a result of  sharply higher import prices. In terms of vol ume, imports decreased to a somewhat greater  extent than exports. The German terms of  trade fell by around 9¼% on the year, as im port prices rose significantly more sharply than  export prices (+26% compared with +14½%). 
In regional terms, the current account surplus  declined particularly vis-à-vis non-euro area  countries, falling by 3  percentage points to  1¾% of GDP. This was chiefly attributable to  the smaller surplus on the goods account. The  high import prices for energy were a major fac 
tor in this context. In addition, the decline in  the services balance also contributed to this re

sult. This reflects the strong increase in travel  vis-à-vis both the rest of the euro area and the  rest of the world. 
From the perspective of savings and invest ment, aggregate net lending/net borrowing fell  considerably, in line with the current account  balance. In this context, net investment relative  to GDP increased only marginally. Enterprises’  investment in machinery and equipment con tinued to see robust growth in 2022 as a result  of catch-up effects. Housing investment like wise grew substantially in nominal terms due  to the sharp rises in construction costs. A more  significant factor behind the decline in net  lending/net borrowing was the strong decrease  in domestic saving. With households needing  to compensate for their loss of purchasing  power and with the normalisation of previously  subdued consumption, the household saving  ratio returned roughly to its pre-pandemic  level. Corporate saving declined as well. This  was attributable partly to higher distributions  and partly to lower transfers received. In 2022,  the government started to wind down its assis tance measures related to the COVID-19 pan demic. Over the course of the year, compre hensive new support measures were gradually

introduced in response to the energy crisis and  the high rates of inflation, but, on the whole,  these measures were smaller in scale than  those of previous years. Overall, net lending/ net borrowing among households and non 
financial corporations fell quite sharply, while  general government’s deficit position de creased. Compared with pre-pandemic levels,  aggregate net lending/net borrowing relative  to GDP was lower in 2022. This is attributable  primarily to general government posting a def icit while households and enterprises made a  broadly similar contribution to what they had  in 2019.

moderate growth of the Chinese economy,  which had also felt the impact of the stringent  measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pan demic. Deliveries to Russia collapsed as a result  of EU sanctions and behavioural adjustments in  response to Russia’s war against Ukraine,  amongst other reasons. Exports to Ukraine also  declined significantly. This was partly offset by  the goods delivered in connection with the  war.3 However, accounting for only 0.3%, ex 
ports to Ukraine were of minimal significance  to German exporters in 2022. 
Export developments were highly heteroge neous across various product categories. In  price-adjusted terms, there was significant  growth in deliveries of consumer goods. Here,  exports of pharmaceutical products saw espe cially strong expansion. Exports of motor ve hicles and motor vehicle parts also rose very  sharply. Motor vehicle production in Germany  stalled at times in March following the out break of Russia’s war against Ukraine, given the  absence of deliveries of motor vehicle parts  from Ukraine.

the prices of energy products. As a result, the  foreign trade surplus narrowed by €95½ billion  to €79½ billion. In price-adjusted terms, how ever, exports were down ½% on the previous  year and imports saw a somewhat stronger dip  of 1¾% on the year.2 
In regional terms, nominal exports to the euro  area countries grew almost as strongly as those  to non-euro area countries. Sales to the United  States saw very significant expansion. This was  supported by the depreciation of the euro  against the US dollar. In addition, German ex

2 Contrary to the foreign trade statistics, real goods ex ports rose by 1½% and goods imports by 2¾% when cal culated using the national accounts approach. One reason  for these divergent developments is that the foreign trade  price indices weight goods according to their shares in the  base year of 2015. In the national accounts, however, price  changes for imported and exported goods are weighted  using the goods’ current shares. During periods that exhibit  highly heterogeneous price increases for individual goods,  such as 2022, there can be marked differences in the  
shares used for each of the two calculation methods. 3 These deliveries included military goods, dual-use goods,  and relief aid totalling €2 billion; see Federal Government  (2023). 
addition, exports of energy products decreased  significantly. This was attributable to declining  exports of gas, which was also due to a drop in  foreign demand for gas.4 By contrast, there  was growth in deliveries of refined petroleum  products and electricity.5

… but lower  energy imports  in price-adjusted  terms 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts in creased considerably in price-adjusted terms. In  this context, a role was played by the fact that  purchases were brought forward seeing as  government subsidies for purchases of electric  vehicles were scaled back at the end of 2022.  Deliveries of machinery likewise recorded  strong expansion. The sharp increase in imports  of intermediate goods benefited from easing  supply bottlenecks. This also affected electronic  and electrical equipment. Imports of chemical  products, which were still stagnating in the  previous year, saw massive growth. One reason  for these imports was probably to substitute  for domestic production, which was throttled  due to energy prices. Deliveries of consumer  goods were also up considerably. 
By contrast, energy imports fell very sharply in  price-adjusted terms owing to a very substan tial decrease in gas imports. This was attribut able to the decline in energy consumption in  Germany as a result of hugely increased energy  prices. The drop in consumption was con nected with both energy savings as well as pro duction cutbacks in individual sectors.6 By con trast, coal imports were expanded, also for use  in power stations. In addition, more crude oil  was delivered to Germany. However, the add itional imports of these energy sources only  
4 See Federal Network Agency (2023). These gas exports  are predominantly transit imports. 
5 A role was also played by increased deliveries of electri city to France, where the nuclear power stations needed to  generate electricity reduced their output due to repair work  and the low water levels of inland waterways required to  cool them. 
6 In addition, consumption was depressed by the com paratively mild weather. See Working Group on Energy Bal ances e.V. (2022).

Much greater  nominal growth  in deliveries

Merchanting  trade and sup plementary  
trade items  
bolstered goods  trade on  
balance 
offset the decline in gas volumes to some ex tent. 
Broken down by region, almost all major trad ing partners recorded very sharp growth in rev enues from their deliveries to Germany. In this  context, nominal imports from non-euro area  countries increased by almost twice as much as  those from euro area countries. First, non-euro  area countries benefited from greater demand  for their specific product mix. They offer a rela tively wide selection of electronic and electrical  equipment as well as clothing. Second, the  prices of energy products, which make up a  larger share of these countries’ product ranges,  went up particularly sharply. The rise in the  prices of energy products was also a key factor  in the growth in Russian revenue from Ger many. By contrast, the volume of energy im ports from Russia plummeted. 
The other components of trade in goods  – which include the supplementary trade items,  net goods exports in merchanting trade, and  trade in non-monetary gold – mitigated the de 
cline in the foreign trade balance overall.7 As a  result, the surplus on the goods account fell by  €82½ billion in 2022, which was much smaller  than the decline in the foreign trade surplus. 
Invisible current transactions 
The balance of the cross-border services ac count was deep into negative territory in 2022.  Having been positive in each of the two pre ceding years of the pandemic, the balance  reached a deficit of €31 billion in the reporting  year. On the one hand, receipts went up by  18% on the year to almost €408 billion in  2022, with revenue growth in the transporta tion sector playing an important role. On the  other hand, however, expenditure rose signifi cantly more strongly, climbing by just under  29%. This was due mainly to the increase in  travel expenditure, which returned to pre pandemic levels, as well as to considerably  higher transport expenditure. 
At €55 billion, the sub-account for cross-border  travel posted the highest nominal deficit in its  
7 This was primarily attributable to the sharp rise in net re ceipts from merchanting trade, which grew by €8 billion,  as sales rose more sharply than purchases overall. A signifi cant contribution to this was made by transactions in the  automotive industry, which generally comprise a large pro portion of such business. In addition, the supplementary  trade items increased by €5 billion on balance. In this con text, a role was also played by the strong rise in imports for  contract processing in Germany. Furthermore, there was a  sharp rise in the c.i.f. charges for imports, amongst others;  these comprise the costs of freight and insurance from the  border of the supplier’s country to the German border. By  contrast, net expenditure for trade in non-monetary gold  remained virtually unchanged.

existence. Travel receipts –  which Germany  generates largely through travel for trade fairs,  events and business trips  – continued to fall  significantly short of pre-pandemic levels. By  contrast, increasing numbers of individuals resi 
dent in Germany were travelling abroad again  as many pandemic-related restrictions were  lifted. Travel expenditure doubled compared  with the year before. The main beneficiaries  were the Mediterranean and Alpine countries.  However, spending on long-distance travel re 
mained significantly below pre-pandemic  levels. It was not until partway through 2022  that travel to Asia, in particular, was again pos sible on a larger scale. 
The sub-account for cross-border transport ser vices had already expanded by around 40%  back in 2021, mainly owing to the increased  freight prices in international goods transport  caused by higher energy prices. Starting from  this elevated level, the reporting year saw fur ther sales increases of more than one-third on  both sides of the balance sheet for fees from  sea, air and ground transport as well as pipe line and electricity transmission. On balance,  the deficit in this sub-account rose moderately,  climbing by €2 billion to €8½ billion for Ger many. Other components of the services ac count related to the goods trade, such as  manufacturing, maintenance and repair ser vices, experienced only marginal changes in  their balances compared with 2021. 
In the reporting year, too, there was a one-off  effect on the revenue side under the item  “Charges for the use of intellectual property”.  As in the previous year, this was related to li 
censing following the development of vac cines. This effect was once again evident and  at just a slightly reduced level, meaning that  the surplus of €31½ billion in the sub-account  was only marginally lower than in the previous  year. 
In the year under review, receipts and expend iture for other knowledge-based and business  services rose fairly sharply. The resulting deficit

… though  
increased sur plus attributable  to investment  income 
of €21½ billion was attributable in around  equal part to cross-border telecommunications  and information services as well as other busi ness services, with the former accounting for a  larger share of year-on-year deficit growth. The  latter services comprise research and develop ment, professional, technical and commercial  services, and management consultancy ser vices. The other components of the services ac count remained virtually unchanged in terms of  both sales and balances. 
Following its massive increase in 2021, the pri mary income surplus also grew significantly in  the reporting year. Given the sharp decline in  the goods surplus, net primary income, at just  under 4% of GDP in 2022 (€150 billion), un usually made up the largest share of the cur rent account surplus. Combined, cross-border  compensation of employees and other primary  income recorded a small deficit. 
The surplus in primary income was mainly at tributable to net investment income. According  to the Bundesbank’s preliminary calculations,  income for domestic investors and capital  donors from cross-border investment grew by  one-sixth. This increase is heavily attributable to  the upturn in receipts from direct investment,  which also includes reinvested earnings. In come from non-euro area investments in creased not only because of high corporate  profits abroad but also because of the weaker  euro exchange rate. In addition, the turn around in interest rates had an impact on  banks’ revenue. Interest income doubled, albeit  from a low level. Payments by domestic actors  to foreign financiers rose by one-quarter in  2022 compared with the previous year. This  was driven mainly by dividend payments on  portfolio investments and other investment ex penditure from the financial sector due to  higher interest rates. Owing to the consider able net external assets of residents in Ger many, it was despite the unusually sharp in crease in expenditure that, for Germany, net in come rose by €15 billion on the year to €153  billion in absolute terms. 
The traditional deficit in the cross-border sec ondary income account widened significantly  last year. The increase of €10 billion to €69 bil lion was due primarily to higher expenditure.  Half of the deterioration in the account balance  was attributable to unilateral non-government  cross-border payments. Growing remittances  from immigrants to their countries of origin  played a certain role in this context. Cash and  non-cash donations made by households to  Ukraine were another factor, though. Govern ment payments to non-residents rose markedly,  while receipts remained broadly unchanged.  On the revenue side, EU coronavirus assistance  decreased considerably in 2022. This gap was  partly plugged by increasing receipts from in come and wealth taxes on non-residents.  Meanwhile, government expenditure went up,  for example as a result of Germany’s contribu tions to the EU budget based on gross national  income as well as government assistance to  Ukraine. 
Capital movements 
Underlying trends in capital  movements 
Reflecting the decline in the current account  surplus, the balance of the financial account, at  €220 billion, was also significantly lower than  in the previous year (€248½ billion).8 In 2022,  Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,  high inflation and the global tightening of  monetary policy impacted the international  financial markets by leading to falling prices in  the equity and bond markets. At the same  time, the high level of uncertainty dampened  investors’ risk appetite, meaning that domestic  fixed income securities were more in demand  than equities, despite the price losses in the  bond markets. 
8 The difference between the current account and financial  account balances is primarily attributable to statistical  errors and omissions (€86 billion).

supply-side constraints continued to exist. Rus sia’s attack on Ukraine at the end of February  then led to massive increases in commodity  and food prices and sharply intensified price  pressures, which also impacted inflation ex pectations in the medium term. As a result,  major central banks moved more quickly to wards monetary policy normalisation. The  Eurosystem therefore decided in March 2022  to scale back net purchases under the asset  purchase programme (APP) more rapidly over  the course of the second quarter than it had  envisaged in December 2021. In addition, the  Governing Council of the ECB began raising its  key interest rates in its July 2022 meeting and  had increased them by a total of 250 basis  points by the end of the year; at its final meet ing of 2022, it made clear that it would con tinue to raise interest rates.

The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims on the ECB

prises was only slightly below the previous  year’s level. Foreign enterprises, too, expanded  their direct investment in Germany, but less so  than in the year before. Other investment partly  mirrored developments in portfolio investment:  as, on balance, German investors sought sig

exceeded the previous year’s figure by €8½ bil lion, thus reaching a new peak. Transactions in  the TARGET2 payment instrument are based on  individual decisions made by a wide range of  participants. These individual decisions, for  their part, are determined by the general  macroeconomic environment but potentially  also by specific characteristics of individual  banks participating in TARGET2. A Bundesbank  study presented on pp. 35ff. examines the ex 
tent to which the balances of the national cen tral banks resulting from individual decisions  are determined by the bank-specific character istics. It concludes that these individual factors

Net purchases of this instru ment amounted to €33½ billion in 2022, which  was well below the previous year’s figure  (€116½ billion).

have played only a minor role in the rise in Ger man TARGET2 claims over the past few years. 
Portfolio investment 
Portfolio investment generated relatively low  net capital exports of €24½ billion in 2022  (previous year: €203½ billion) amidst a signifi cant drop in trading volumes. One major rea son for this decline is likely to have been the  high level of uncertainty in the markets as a re sult of high inflation and Russia’s war of ag gression against Ukraine. This uncertainty was  reflected in reduced risk appetite, meaning that  investors, on the whole, were reluctant to  make investment decisions regarding securities.  Similarly sharp declines occurred in 2020  (coronavirus pandemic) and 2011 (European  sovereign debt crisis). 
Against this backdrop, portfolio investment  abroad by German investors rose by only €16½  
tage of these debt securities, investors opting  for a safe haven in connection with the war of  aggression against Ukraine is likely to have  played a role here. There was also high de 
mand for interest-bearing instruments from  Canada and Ireland. 
Decreased risk appetite and investor caution is  even more evident in the equities segment. On  balance, resident investors sold shares of for eign enterprises for a net amount of €16½ bil lion. In the previous year, they had expanded  their portfolios by €47 billion. In the first quar ter, German investors offloaded European  shares, in particular. This behaviour is consist ent with the especially sharp drop in European  equity indices following Russia’s attack on  Ukraine.9 However, this trend reversed as the  year progressed. Over the course of 2022 as a  whole, German investors sold shares from  France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in  particular. By contrast, they acquired a large  volume of equities from the United States, Can ada and Australia.

they offloaded money market paper (€37 bil lion). This is likely to have been due in part to  the declining outstanding volume of German  short-term debt securities. In view of rising  interest rates, it became more attractive for do mestic market participants to raise funding via  secured loans (repo transactions). At the same  time, foreign investors sought bonds issued by  enterprises, the public sector and banks –  worth a combined €37½ billion. Net purchases  of the first two instruments were made by the  Eurosystem under the pandemic emergency  purchase programme (PEPP) until March 2022  and under the APP until June 2022. In the past,  net asset purchases for monetary policy pur poses were a major reason why, on balance,  foreign investors sold domestic debt securities.  With the expiry of the purchase programmes, a  dominant domestic buyer has now exited the  market. 
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to  form a single item in the balance of payments)  recorded net capital exports of €42½ billion in  2022, a clear decline from the year before (€60  
Deutsche Bundesbank 
billion). Forward and futures contracts relating  to electricity and gas bucked this general trend,  however. Amid the turbulence in the energy  markets, net capital exports were recorded. In  the previous year, trading in this segment had  still yielded German net capital imports. 
Direct investment 
The large number of events and developments  that fuelled global uncertainty in 2022 also af fected global direct investment. The United Na tions Conference on Trade and Development  (UNCTAD) observed a marked decline in new  investment projects after the first quarter of  2022 and the start of the Russian war of ag gression against Ukraine. This included green field project announcements as well as inter national project finance deals and cross-border  mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Nevertheless,  according to UNCTAD’s estimate, the number  of greenfield project announcements was

When  examined in detail, the figures aggregated  across all countries and regions were driven by  fairly different developments.10 
German enterprises operating internationally  also faced particular challenges in 2022. The  coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine,  as well as their far-reaching economic conse 
quences, significantly hampered cross-border  business for many enterprises and also influ enced their investment decisions.11 An environ ment with more risks and greater uncertainty  – including for business conditions – makes it  harder to calculate cross-border exposures.  However, direct investment is generally longer term in nature. It is affected less immediately  by acute events than other forms of investment  that instead pursue short-term returns.12 Ger man inward and outward direct investment  therefore proved to be quite robust in 2022  despite the particularly difficult economic envir onment. It recorded net capital exports of  €125½ billion – a new peak from a long-term  perspective, even exceeding the particularly  high figure of €100½ billion the previous year.  This was partly due to the fact that German  outward investment once again grew very  strongly, while foreign investment in Germany  was noticeably weaker than in the previous

12 Direct investment is usually more long-term in nature,  and adjustments are also more likely to take place over the  longer term. Nevertheless, shorter-term arrangements be tween affiliated enterprises also affect cross-border direct  investment flows. For example, this may be the case when  an entity in one country provides certain cross-border  financial services to entities in other countries. In recent  years, this sort of cross-border relocation of business activ 
ity has been observed in the context of the United King dom’s withdrawal from the European Union, which is also  reflected time and again in direct investment flows to and  from Germany.

This  was mainly due to net capital exports of €11½  billion in the banking system, which had re corded net capital imports of €152 billion in  2021. On balance, both claims and liabilities  falling under “other investment” increased sig nificantly less in 2022 than in the previous year.

Do bank- specifi c factors affect net cross- border  
transactions in TARGET2?* 
At the onset of the global fi nancial crisis,  TARGET2 claims on the ECB began to accu mulate on the Bundesbank’s balance sheet.  In the years that followed, periods charac terised by growing balances alternated with  phases of temporary declines. The Bundes bank regularly comments on the develop ment of TARGET2 balances in the Euro system in its Monthly Reports as well as in  its Annual Report.1 These analyses are  based on macroeconomic interrelationships  and, as of 2015, on the evaluation of asset  purchases made by the Eurosystem under  the asset purchase programme (APP). 
By contrast, the present analysis focuses on  microeconomic factors, looking at the bilat eral payments of individual banks in  TARGET2. The analysis differentiates be tween customer payments, interbank pay ments, intragroup payments of banks con nected to the system, transactions related  to the settlement of ancillary systems, and  transactions involving at least one (domes tic or foreign) central bank. The study is  based on transaction data from the German  
Bundesbank's TARGET2 balance 
€ billion 
component of the Eurosystem’s TARGET2  settlement system (TARGET2- Bundesbank)  covering the period from January 2009 to  December 2021. The micro data enable re 
lationships to be identifi ed not only at the  country level but also for individual credit  institutions. These micro data are linked to  the yearly data on the balance sheets and  profi t and loss accounts of domestic and  foreign banks provided by BankFocus (Bur 
eau van Dijk). In the empirical analysis,  these serve as explanatory variables for the  TARGET2 transactions. 
The chart below shows end- of- month val ues of the German TARGET2 balance from  January 2003 to February 2023. TARGET2  claims increased sharply during three time  periods: between the onset of the global  fi nancial market crisis in 2008 and the peak  of the European sovereign debt crisis in  mid- 2012, upon the launch of the public  sector purchase programme (PSPP) in early

virus pandemic and subsequent implemen 
tation of the pandemic emergency pur 
chase programme (PEPP) in 2020. 
In the analysis presented here, we investi 
gate the extent to which individual charac 
teristics of the commercial banks participat 
ing in TARGET2 also infl uence the develop 
ment of TARGET2 balances alongside the  
macroeconomic relationships that have al 
ready been examined. To study this aspect,  
we use transaction data from TARGET2-  
Bundesbank relating to individual bank ac 
counts. The raw data comprise bilateral  
pairs: a sender and a recipient of euro pay 
ments. Either the sender or the recipient  
has to be a bank holding an account in  
TARGET2- Bundesbank. By contrast, the  
partner bank must be connected to  
TARGET2 abroad, as domestic transactions  
have no impact on Germany’s TARGET2  
balance. The analysis assigns a bank to a  
specifi c country according to the TARGET2  component in which the account is held. 
The TARGET2 transaction data contain in formation about the type of payment. This  is derived from the corresponding text fi eld  of the SWIFT message that is used.2 The  chart below shows the 12- month moving  average of total net cross- border fl ows to  German banks for the period from January  2009 to December 2021 and compares the  overall development of net fl ows to Ger man banks with the development of the  following categories of transaction: cus tomer payments, interbank payments, in tragroup payments of connected banks,  central bank payments, payments related to  
2 SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial  Telecommunication) is a cooperative institution estab lished by banks that operates a network for the ex change of electronic messages, especially payment  messages. A SWIFT payment message is merely a pay ment instruction; the payment is settled via a payment  system or correspondent banking connection.

ancillary systems, and other transactions  (rest). In general, the developments in each  category vary strongly depending on the  specifi c type of transaction. Customer pay 
ments, interbank payments and central  bank payments in particular tend to in crease Germany’s overall TARGET2 claims.3 
The positive balance (infl ows minus out fl ows) of customer payments corresponds  to Germany’s current account surpluses  during the observation period. However, in dividual customer payments are not neces sarily linked to current account transactions,  since they may also refl ect transactions  made on behalf of customers, such as  securities purchases or other forms of in vestment. The positive net fl ows in inter bank payments may refl ect different fi nan cing conditions among commercial banks in  the euro area. For example, German banks  may generally fi nd it relatively easy to ob tain liquidity from private markets, whereas  banks in other countries in some cases rely  more heavily on open market operations  with the central bank. This might favour  payment fl ows towards Germany. Finally,  central bank payments also continually in creased Germany’s TARGET2 balance. 
Other types of transaction have a negative  impact on German TARGET2 claims, namely  intragroup payments and transactions re lated to the settlement of ancillary systems.4 One possible interpretation of the negative  intragroup balance is that German banks,  which hold a large part of the Eurosystem’s  excess liquidity, provide loans to their for eign branches and subsidiaries. The nega tive balance of ancillary system transactions  is large but diffi cult to interpret from an  economic perspective, as information on  the underlying transactions is not available.5 This also applies to the residual “other trans actions” category, as it predominantly con tains transactions conducted more for tech

TARGET2 balance compared with the previous  year; in 2021, the increase was significantly  higher, at €125 billion. By contrast, the Bundes bank’s liabilities to non-residents arising from  currency and deposits fell by €90½ billion in  2022. The bulk of the decline was driven by  lower deposits from non-euro area residents  compared with the end of December 2021. At  that time, the Bundesbank’s counterparties  from non-euro area countries had temporarily  increased their deposits particularly sharply at  the end of the year.15 The Bundesbank’s liabil

On balance, their claims on  foreign enterprises and households increased  more strongly than their claims on foreign  banks.
