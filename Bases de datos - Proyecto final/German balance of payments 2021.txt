German balance of payments in 2021 
In 2021, the German economy’s current account surplus increased by ½ percentage point to  7½% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). The surplus more or less returned to its pre pandemic level, following its short-lived decline in the previous year. It was chiefly the primary  income surplus that grew in size, while the balances of the goods account, services account and  secondary income remained largely unchanged. This outcome is only partly attributable to the  reversal of developments observed in the first year of the pandemic. The primary income surplus  recovered owing to a higher level of income from Germany’s outward foreign direct investment  amid the upswing in most host countries, and German exporters benefited from a rebound in for eign demand. However, strong increases in import prices in connection with pandemic-related  supply bottlenecks reduced the surplus in the goods account. In addition, Germans’ continued  low spending on travel together with exceptionally high receipts from patents for vaccines in  2021 had a positive impact on Germany’s services account, which usually runs a deficit. 
From a saving and investment perspective, the rise in the current account surplus was attributable  mainly to increased saving, which exceeded the cyclical recovery in investment. Saving by non financial corporations went up, which may, to some extent, have been for precautionary and  deleveraging purposes after the crisis-related strains of the year before. While household saving  was down, it remained significantly above its pre-crisis level. Given the presence of temporary,  persistently large crisis-related burdens, the general government deficit remained broadly  unchanged. 
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic affected not only the current account but also international  capital flows in 2021. In particular, expansionary fiscal and monetary policy responses to the pan demic in many countries affected cross-border activities. At the same time, inflation rates and  expectations rose in many places over the course of the year. As a result, a number of major cen tral banks returned to a slightly more restrictive monetary policy. For example, the US Fed began  tapering its net asset purchases in November and the Bank of England raised its Bank Rate. Other  central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Canada and the Bank of  Japan announced that they were considering either scaling back or fully discontinuing their asset  purchase programmes. All in all, at €314½ billion in 2021, Germany’s net capital exports were  substantially higher than in the year before (€216½ billion). 
Portfolio investment, financial derivatives and direct investment saw net capital exports. By con trast, other investment predominantly gave rise to capital inflows, with the Bundesbank’s external  claims from a higher TARGET2 balance rising less strongly than its external liabilities. Besides  larger deposits from non-resident counterparties and the above average issuance of euro bank notes, a one-off effect stemming from the allocation of special drawing rights by the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) had an impact here. In turn, the allocation of special drawing rights caused  the Bundesbank’s reserve assets to grow.

In a year-on-year comparison, Germany’s cur rent account surplus rose by €26½ billion in  2021 to €265½ billion. The balance increased  by ½  percentage point to 7½% of nominal  GDP. However, Germany’s current account sur plus shrank over the course of the year. The  country’s current account surplus amounted to  8¼% of GDP in the first quarter, decreasing as  the year progressed to a seasonally adjusted  5½% in the final quarter.

Relative to GDP, however, it went down  slightly. While the economic recovery of Ger many’s trading partners raised the surplus in  the reporting year by way of volume effects,  these effects were outweighed by the impact  of strong import price increases in connection  with pandemic-related supply bottlenecks. The  deterioration in German terms of trade over  the course of the year was amplified by the rise  in energy prices, in particular. In addition,  supply-side production constraints in Germany

Other economies, in cluding those in the euro area, were still lag ging behind in terms of economic activity due  to divergent pandemic developments and  measures taken to combat them. Second, the  global boost in demand led to delivery delays  and shortages of important intermediate goods  in light of the pandemic-related production  and transport problems. This led to steep in creases in the prices of inputs and industrial  raw materials. The prices of fossil fuels also  rose, in some cases drastically, in view of high  demand and scarce supply.

International Economics, natural gas and coal  prices have tripled and doubled, respectively.2 German exporters also faced slight headwinds  stirred up by the appreciation of the euro. The  currency’s nominal effective exchange rate  against the currencies of the euro area’s 42  most important trading partners, on average  across 2021, was roughly 1¼% higher than the  previous year’s level. 
From a regional perspective, the current ac count surplus vis-à-vis euro area countries rose  to 3% of GDP, with increases in the balances of  the goods account and primary income ex ceeding the larger deficit in the services ac count. The current account surplus vis-à-vis  non-euro area countries remained unchanged,  at 4½% of GDP. Here, increases in the balances  of primary income and the services account  offset the decrease in the goods surplus. 
Aggregate net lending/net borrowing rose  slightly relative to GDP in the reporting year.3 Both domestic investment and domestic saving  recovered significantly on aggregate, but did  not completely rebound from the low levels of  the previous year.

up effects in business investment. Meanwhile,  private residential investment increased sharply.  While household saving was down, it remained  significantly above its pre-crisis level due to cer 
tain opportunities to consume, such as trips  abroad, being available only to a limited extent  or not being taken up to the same extent as  before the outbreak of the coronavirus pan

the reporting year was still slightly below the  annual average for 2019, a level to which im ports returned. In 2021, the year-on-year in crease in exports and particularly imports was  far higher in terms of value than in price adjusted terms, at 14% and 17% respectively.  On balance, the foreign trade balance fell by  €7½ billion to €173 billion. 
The recovery of Germany’s foreign trade activ ities from their pandemic-related slump in 2020  slowed down over the course of 2021. The  main reason for this was sluggish industrial ac tivity in Germany and its trading partners for  large parts of the reporting year; this activity  was hampered by delivery delays and materials  shortages in the second half of the year, in par ticular. In real terms, total exports in the fourth  quarter were up by only 1½% on the year, and  imports were down by 1¾%. 
In regional terms, German exporters recorded  very strong increases in sales to almost every  partner country in the euro area. Deliveries to  countries outside the euro area also saw strong

Goods flows  
and balance of trade 
At 8% in price-adjusted terms, goods exports  recorded very strong year-on-year growth in  2021. Imports of goods grew less strongly, by  3¼%. The fact that exports of certain capital  goods such as machinery and motor vehicles  
growth. In this context, the increases in sales to  central and eastern European countries as well  as to the United States were especially pro nounced. In addition, there was perceptible  growth in exports to commodity-exporting  countries such as Russia, Brazil and South  Africa, which are also likely to have benefited  from greater scope for expenditure as a result  of income from their commodity sales. Sales to  China likewise recorded a significant increase in  line with the strong expansion of the Chinese  economy. By contrast, exports to the United  Kingdom declined markedly as the transitional  period ensuring reciprocal market access under  EU single market rules had come to an end. 
With regard to the range of exported goods,  practically all areas saw very steep growth in  price-adjusted terms in the year under review.

declined further. Very strong growth was re corded by exports of electrical equipment,  chemical products, computers, and electronic  and optical products. Exports of consumer  goods also made strong gains. This was bol stered by the very sharp hike in demand for  pharmaceutical products; in this context, the  global need for coronavirus vaccines made in  Germany also played a major role. 
Imports of intermediate goods saw very steep  growth. Among capital goods, there was an  especially sharp rise in deliveries of machinery  and equipment from foreign manufacturers.  These benefited from an improvement in the  pandemic situation leading to a reduction in  uncertainty, which had also weighed on the in 
vestment plans of German enterprises. Mean while, imports of motor vehicles and motor ve hicle parts suffered heavily from global supply  bottlenecks and saw only moderate growth.  Deliveries of consumer goods rose steeply, with  imports of pharmaceutical products expanding  especially strongly, which was linked to the  need for coronavirus vaccines and tests. 
Broken down by region, deliveries from the  euro area and from other countries saw simi larly strong growth in price-adjusted terms,  with manufacturers in almost every partner  country recording growth in their sales to Ger many. Among Germany’s major trading part ners in the euro area, imports from Belgium  grew exceptionally strongly in terms of value,  with coronavirus vaccines produced in that  country also playing a significant role. Among  third countries, key energy suppliers such as  Russia and the OPEC countries saw very consid erable revenue growth from sales to Germany,

Massive rise in  services sales;  strong impact  of one-off  
developments 
which was partly due to inflation for energy  products. 
The other components of trade in goods  –  which comprise the supplementary trade  items, net goods exports in merchanting trade  and trade in non-monetary gold – more than  compensated for the decline in the foreign  trade surplus overall. In net terms, the goods  surplus rose by €2½ billion in 2021.4 
Invisible current transactions 
In the cross-border trade in services, receipts  and expenditure rose steeply in 2021, similarly  to the goods trade, following the slump in the  previous year. At 17½%, services exports grew  to the same extent as services imports, which  rose by 18½%. As a result, this account, which  had posted large deficits in the past and re 
corded a slight surplus for the first time in many  decades during the course of the pandemic,  also posted a small surplus of €½ billion last  year. However, this was only partially attribut 
able to the recovery, i.e. a return to pre pandemic conditions. One-off developments in  certain sub-accounts had a major impact on  the overall services account. 
Before the outbreak of the coronavirus pan demic, German residents’ traditionally high for eign travel expenditure was responsible for the  large deficit in the services account. With gains  of €6½ billion in the year under review, this  item saw hardly any recovery following its  coronavirus-related collapse of almost three fifths – or nearly €50 billion – in the first year of  the pandemic. Due to the pandemic situation  and the associated obstacles to travel, long distance journeys in particular, but also Alpine  winter tourism, were even weaker in 2021 than  they had been in the previous year. By contrast,  expenditure for summer travel to Mediterra nean countries rose again. In terms of travel in come – which is dominated by travel for trade  fairs, events and business trips – Germany has  seen no recovery thus far. The deficit in the  travel account, which has been shrinking  strongly over the course of the pandemic so  
4 On balance, the higher supplementary trade items were  the key factor in this. Here, there was a very sharp rise in  the c.i.f. charges for imports, amongst others; these com prise the costs of freight and insurance from the border of  the supplier’s country to the German border. Furthermore,  net income from merchanting trade rose steeply by €6½  billion, as receipts from sales grew to a larger extent than  expenditure for purchases. In this context, a key role was  played by transactions in the automotive industry; a consid 
erable share of merchanting transactions are generally at tributable to this industry. This was contrasted by a rise of  €7 billion in net expenditure for trade in non-monetary  gold. Here, transaction values rose on the expenditure side  and fell on the receipts side.

Cross-border transport services reflect goods related economic activity in the services sector  and, for Germany, are normally in deficit. Fol lowing the decline in both receipts and ex penditure in this area resulting from the re duced trade in goods in 2020, both sides of the  balance sheet were extended significantly be yond their pre-crisis levels during the year  under review. However, this was only partially  attributable to the renewed considerable rise in  import and export volumes. Due to disrupted  supply chains and higher energy prices, there  was a massive increase in freight rates for inter national goods transport. Forwarding agents,  shipping companies and air transport enter prises domiciled in Germany benefited from  this, making gains of more than 41% over the  previous year. However, domestic customers’  expenditure with non-resident transport com panies also grew, by 39%. As a result of this  development, the deficit that had been ac crued in this sub-account in the previous year  widened only slightly by €2½ billion. Other  components of the services account related to  the goods trade, such as manufacturing, main tenance and repair services, experienced only  marginal changes in their balances compared  with 2020. 
The very steep rise in services receipts in 2021  was significantly bolstered by a one-off effect  in charges for the use of intellectual property.  In this item, expenditure rose by €3 billion,  while receipts grew by just over €17 billion. Li 
cence fees for vaccines played a major role in  this context. As a result, the surplus grew mas sively in 2021 to €32 billion. 
In the year under review, receipts and expend iture for other knowledge-based and business  services saw somewhat below average growth.  Here, the deficit for cross-border telecommuni cations and information services remained vir

Following a decline in 2020, the surplus on the  primary income balance widened again consid erably in the year under review. Germany’s re ceipts from abroad exceeded payments to  other countries by €126½ billion and were thus  higher than they had been immediately prior to  the pandemic. Combined, cross-border com pensation of employees and other primary in come were almost balanced, as in the preced ing year. The dominant balance sheet item was  investment income. In the second year of the  pandemic, corporate earnings saw a strong re covery. Net receipts from cross-border invest ment rose by €29 billion compared with the  first year of the pandemic, amounting to €126

There was limited  recovery in receipts in the area of other busi ness services from abroad. By contrast, expend iture for research and development, profes sional, technical and commercial services, as  well as management consultancy services grew  to a greater extent. In net terms, the deficit in  this category widened by around €4 billion. 
In the year under review, domestic enterprises  generated a slightly smaller surplus from cross border financial services and insurance and  
billion according to preliminary calculations. In  this context, receipts to resident investors and  capital donors from foreign investments grew  massively by more than one-sixth, reaching a  total of €213 billion. This rise is largely attribut 
able to the upswing in receipts from direct in vestment, although this had also been pre ceded by a very sharp drop. By contrast, pay ments to foreign financiers saw hardly any  
growth, rising by ½%, and thus remained far  short of the pre-crisis level. This was partly due  to the fact that the rise in payments from resi dents to non-resident capital donors for their  direct investment was somewhat counterbal anced by a corresponding decline in expend iture for portfolio investment.

turn in 2020, enterprises and financial players  started 2021 with confidence and hopeful for a  rapid upswing, with vaccination campaigns  being launched in some advanced economies  at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.  The ongoing fiscal support and the strongly ex 
pansionary monetary policy also stimulated in vestors’ risk appetite. 
However, the spread of new virus variants  showed that the coronavirus pandemic was still  far from over. Furthermore, in the second half  of the year, unexpectedly high inflation rates  and emerging inflation concerns increasingly  proved to be a strain. Some central banks  reacted by ushering in or at least signalling a  tighter monetary policy stance: for example,  the Fed in the United States tapered its asset  purchases as of November, and the Bank of  England increased its base rate (Bank Rate). The  Eurosystem announced a marked reduction in  the total envelope of its purchase programmes:  the net purchases under the pandemic emer gency purchase programme (PEPP) will be dis

This deteriorating economic  environment was compounded by mounting  political risks relating to the Russia-Ukraine  conflict that had already begun to escalate in  2021.

Impact of foreign capital controls on German fi nancial  fl ows* 
In recent years, numerous countries have  made greater use of capital controls in  order to shield themselves from undesirable  external disturbances or prevent outfl ows  due to internal imbalances. The administra 
tive design of these interventions has varied  considerably in the specifi cs, depending on  the motive. International organisations such  as the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  and the Organisation for Economic Co 
operation and Development (OECD) have  engaged in in- depth discussions of the cir cumstances under which interventions in  fi nancial fl ows can be justifi ed.1 
There is no consensus on the impact of cap ital controls in the academic literature. Klein  (2012) argues that temporary capital con trols have no marked effect on the growth  of fi nancial variables, on the real exchange  rate or on growth in gross domestic prod uct (GDP). By contrast, Erten and Ocampo  (2016) conclude that capital controls can  help to reduce macroeconomic instabilities,  therefore lending themselves to use as  countercyclical policy instruments. In their  literature review, Erten, Korinek and Oc ampo (2021) show that different methods  for measuring fi nancial fl ows are a key rea son why empirical studies arrive at differing  results. 
A large number of studies have so far fo cused on emerging market economies. This  analysis looks at whether foreign capital  controls reduce cross- border fi nancial trans actions between Germany and its partner  countries. It explicitly does not set out to  assess whether or not the measures imple mented were effective. The study uses dec larations from the German balance of pay ments statistics for the period from January  1999 to December 2017. The transactions  
are available at a monthly frequency, but for  most parts of the analysis they are aggre gated to annual values because the meas ures for capital controls only vary over the  years. The data permit a much more de tailed analysis than studies using macro data, which have so far dominated the rele vant literature. 
The balance of payments data are aug mented by information on capital controls.  To this end, this analysis uses the database  of Fernández et al. (2016). The authors gen erate binary variables of the IMF’s Annual  Report on Exchange Arrangements and Ex change Restrictions (AREAER) for a total of  99 countries to form aggregate indices. In  doing so, they concentrate on the AREAER’s  capital account category and thus on direct  effects on fi nancial fl ows. This approach re sembles that of Chinn and Ito (2008),2 but  unlike them, Fernández et al. (2016) defi ne  separate measures for infl ows and out fl ows, broken down into ten different asset  categories. 
The fi rst question addressed is whether cap ital controls in general reduce Germany’s  cross- border fi nancial fl ows. To this end, the  empirical study uses a panel setting with  multiple fi xed effects: 
* This analysis is based on a research paper by Gold bach and Nitsch (2020). 
1 See IMF (2012) and OECD (2015). 
2 The measure applied by Chinn and Ito (2008) is used  very frequently in the empirical literature. However, the  measure only provides indications for total fi nancial  fl ows and thus is not broken down into infl ows and  outfl ows or into different asset categories. Further 
more, the measure is based on a broader approach: all  four of the overarching AREAER categories (FX Re gime, Export Proceeds, Capital Account and Current  Account) are used. This index therefore also takes into  account indirect effects on fi nancial fl ows which are  attributable to export restrictions, for example.

Other control variables for cross- border  fi nancial fl ows are real GDP per capita,  stock market capitalisation, real GDP  growth and the government debt- to- GDP  ratio. 
The above table illustrates the estimation  results for three different indices. The con trol variables are excluded in the baseline  specifi cation (columns 1 to 3); for compari son, the estimation results including control  variables are shown in columns 4 to 6. This  table indicates that both the aggregate  index and the separate indices for controls  on infl ows and outfl ows have a signifi cantly  negative effect on Germany’s bilateral  fi nancial fl ows. The results of the baseline  specifi cation and of the version with control  variables are very similar. The control vari ables themselves have a signifi cant effect  on fi nancial fl ows in some cases. How  fi nancial fl ows react to capital controls can  depend on whether these controls are im plemented on a temporary or long- term  basis.

fect. The negative impact on cross- border  fi nancial fl ows is thus attributable to strict  and long- term capital controls. 
The microdata can be used to examine fur ther mechanisms. For example, the effect of  capital controls on market entries (“exten sive margin”) and on the change in existing  business relationships (“intensive margin”)  can be assessed independently of one an other. To do so, total German fi nancial  fl ows with a given partner country are de composed into multiple elements, such as  the number of declarants or the average  volume of an ongoing entry (at the  declarant- asset- month level). 
The above table presents the estimation re sults. As before, the β coeffi cient is nega tive. Capital controls thus appear to have an  effect on both the extensive (number) and  intensive (average value) margin of bilateral  fi nancial relationships. However, roughly  half of the coeffi cients are statistically insig nifi cant. The strongest effect occurs for in fl ows to Germany. Other control variables  generally do not affect the results. 
In a fi nal step, the effects of temporary cap ital controls within the European Union are  studied. Starting in spring 2010, market  participants increasingly began to have  doubts about the solvency of the Greek  government. This mounting nervousness  was also felt by Cyprus, which had close

economic and fi nancial ties to Greece. Con cerned about the stability of its domestic  banking sector, Cyprus implemented capital  controls in March 2013, which remained in  place until April 2015. The measures in cluded a restriction on transferring money  abroad. Greece imposed capital controls it self in June 2015, which were lifted in  stages up until September 2019. 
The previous approach is modifi ed as fol lows: the study uses monthly data and con structs a balanced panel for European  Union countries. A binary variable takes the  value of one for Greece and Cyprus if cap ital controls are implemented in the re spective country at the time. Control vari ables are the real effective exchange rate,  infl ation, reserve assets, long- term govern ment bond yields and the stock market re turn. 
The above table illustrates the estimation  results. The previous results are confi rmed.  
Capital controls within the European Union  also reduce Germany’s cross- border fi nan cial fl ows. Since the capital controls were  introduced in Greece and Cyprus during  turbulent times, the control variables serve  as further important factors. The estimated  effect even becomes stronger as soon as  these variables are taken into account in  the regressions. 
The aim of this study was to examine  whether foreign capital controls reduce  Germany’s bilateral fi nancial fl ows. The re sults support this thesis. Long- term meas ures, in particular, explain this relationship.  In addition, capital controls introduced  abroad reduce market entries by domestic  players – which is to say, the establishment  of fi nancial relationships with foreign par ticipants – (or lead to market exits) as well  as transactions in existing business relation ships. It was also demonstrated that capital  controls within the European Union have  this effect as well.

euro – despite the appreciation of other key  currencies against the euro. These euro denominated instruments made up over two thirds of German net purchases. Among the  public sector bonds denominated in euro, Ital ian government debt securities were particu larly sought after, followed by instruments is sued by Austria or the European Union. The lat ter instruments included the EU’s new issues to  fund the European unemployment insurance  programme (Support to mitigate Unemploy ment Risks in an Emergency – SURE) and the  European Recovery and Resilience Facility  (NextGenerationEU – NGEU). 
German investors’ purchases of foreign cur rency bonds (€23½ billion) were spread across  multiple countries, with issuance from the  United States and the United Kingdom being  the most significant. By contrast, domestic in vestors offloaded money market instruments  issued abroad on balance (€6½ billion). 
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU  left its mark on German portfolio investment in  2021 as well. The country finally left the Euro pean single market at the start of the year. The  free trade agreement between the United King dom and the EU largely excludes financial ser vices. In order to retain access to European  financial markets, banks with an international  focus have moved parts of their business out of  the United Kingdom over the last few years to  existing or newly established subsidiaries in  Germany and other EU countries. This primarily  relates to investment banking. This led, in par ticular, to a strong rise in the purchases and  sales of foreign securities by financial institu tions located here. Thus, transaction volumes  virtually doubled from 2020 to 2021. That said,  this increase in gross flows was not reflected in  the aforementioned net portfolio investment  figures for Germany, as the German branches  of international commercial banks frequently  
In 2021, foreign investors sold securities issued  in Germany to the tune of €33½ billion on bal ance. In 2020, they had still been adding large  volumes of domestic paper to their portfolios  (€149 billion). The acquisition of structured  debt securities from German issuers had played  a major role at the time.7 This effect was much  less significant in the year under review. 
On the whole, foreign investors scaled back  their holdings of German long-term debt secur ities in particular (€52 billion), with their sales  of public sector bonds alone amounting to  €75½ billion net. The Bundesbank’s purchases  under the APP and the PEPP had an impact in  this regard. By contrast, non-resident investors  added private bonds issued in Germany to their  portfolios on balance (€23 billion), stocking up  on corporate bonds and divesting themselves  of bank bonds. They also parted with German  shares (€3½ billion) and mutual fund shares  (€3 billion). 
This development is consistent with the picture  that German equity indices have underper formed against the indices of other advanced  economies and that the euro has depreciated  against key currencies. However, non-residents  parked more liquidity in domestic money mar ket instruments (€25 billion), of which around  two-fifths were the structured securities men tioned earlier. The fact that the Federal govern ment issued a large volume of short-dated  bonds also became noticeable in the first quar ter. 
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to  form a single item in the balance of payments)  recorded net capital exports of €61 billion in  
7 In turn, the German affiliates involved purchased external  assets in the form of economically equivalent derivatives or  fixed-term deposits within their financial group, and they  are recorded under financial derivatives or other invest 
ment. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b).

The main reason behind this de crease was fewer compensatory intra-group  transactions in the form of over-the-counter  options for the aforementioned transactions in  structured debt securities. Nevertheless, they  still account for just under half of the total bal ance of derivatives. On balance, a small volume  of funds was invested in options and forward  contracts. Cross-border forward and futures  contracts relating to electricity and gas re corded net capital imports, whereas they had  still registered net capital exports in 2020. 
Direct investment 
Despite the persistently challenging environ ment caused by the coronavirus pandemic,  global direct investment flows rebounded in  2021 after having declined considerably in  2020. The United Nations Conference on Trade  and Development estimates that global direct  investment flows rose by 77% on the year in  2021 and were thus higher than before the  outbreak of the pandemic.8 The observed re covery varied considerably not only across re gions but also across different sectors and  types of cross-border direct investment. For ex ample, greenfield investment activity remained  much lower on average across all industrial sec tors than prior to the pandemic. By contrast,  there were higher flows of cross-border fund ing for infrastructure in many economic sectors  through project financing. Mergers and acqui sitions also picked up significantly, especially in  the services sector. All in all, direct investment  flows to advanced economies rose much more  strongly than those to developing countries. A  higher number of cross-border mergers and ac quisitions were also carried out in advanced  economies than in other countries. 
German enterprises were no exception in this  regard. Compared with the preceding year,

imports. 
German enterprises invested €163½ billion  abroad in 2021, around €44 billion more than  in 2020. Once again, they strongly expanded  their equity investments in foreign affiliates in  particular (€113 billion). Similarly sized portions  of these funds were for equity capital in the  narrower sense and reinvested earnings. Com 
paratively high cross-border transaction values  were recorded for enterprises specialised in  providing professional and technical services.10 Last year, too, cross-border corporate take overs by enterprises domiciled in Germany  played a significant role in terms of volume.11 
Enterprises domiciled in Germany issued €50½  billion in intra-group credit to foreign affiliated  enterprises in 2021, significantly more than in  2020 (€29½ billion), predominantly in the form  of loans. These loans were issued to subsidiar 
ies and affiliates abroad. Subsidiaries domiciled  in Germany also made large amounts of funds  available to their foreign parent enterprises.

investments in 2021 were in partner countries  in Europe. Just over a third of all German direct  investment was thus made in other euro area  countries. Within the euro area, particularly  large amounts flowed into Luxembourg and  the Netherlands, both significant holding com 
pany locations. Outside the euro area but still  within Europe, comparatively high amounts  were made available to affiliated enterprises in  Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Outside  Europe, the United States was the recipient of  considerable German investment. 
– including changes in sign – but the reversal of  trend in 2021 was particularly large. 
This was largely due to considerable net in flows reported via the banking system. The  Bundesbank’s liabilities to non-residents arising  from currency and deposits increased by €196  billion in 2021. For the most part, the increase  in foreign liabilities was driven by a rise in  deposits of non-euro area residents at the  Bundesbank. This includes the balances of for eign central banks, monetary authorities, inter national organisations and commercial banks.

Foreign enterprises provided domestic enter prises with direct investment funds totalling  €62 billion in 2021. This was about half the  amount of funds provided to affiliated enter prises in 2020 in net terms, a year in which the  inflow of capital was fairly large even in com parison to previous years. Foreign firms boosted  the equity capital they provided to German  branches by €37 billion. Moreover, they also  made €25 billion in loans available to affiliated  enterprises domiciled in Germany, largely via  trade credits. 
Direct investment by firms from the United  Kingdom was especially high (€23 billion). This  was dominated by intra-group lending, which  has been noticeably gaining importance over  the last few years, not least because of reloca 
tion of business activities to Germany. Enter prises in Germany received a combined €35½  billion from euro area countries in 2021. The  majority of these funds were also distributed  via intra-group lending. 
Other investment 
Other investment, comprising loans and trade  credits (where these do not constitute direct in vestment) as well as bank deposits and other  assets, saw net capital imports of €135 billion  in 2021. In 2020, other investment gave rise to  net capital exports of €81 billion. The balance  of other investment often sees high volatility  
These deposits often show a clear temporary  rise at the end of a given year – as was the case  in 2021.12 The Bundesbank’s liabilities arising  from the allocation of euro banknotes within  the Eurosystem went up by €36½ billion last  year. Above and beyond that, the counterpart  of special drawing rights allocated by the IMF  recorded as a liability also rose strongly (see the  reserve assets section on pp. 55f. for further in formation). 
The Bundesbank’s gross claims on non residents also increased (by €123½ billion) in  2021. These primarily reflected the Bundes bank’s higher TARGET2 claims on the ECB  (€124½ billion). Their recent increase mirrored  increased asset purchases as part of the APP  and PEPP. The close relationship between the  development of the Bundesbank’s TARGET2  claims and asset purchases by Eurosystem cen tral banks had already been observed in previ ous years.13 In 2021, the corresponding rise in  German TARGET2 claims was, however, com paratively small. This was down to the counter vailing effects of the financing and outpayment  flows resulting from the European support pro grammes NGEU and SURE.14 On balance, the  transaction-related increase in liabilities was  €103½ billion larger than the increase in the  Bundesbank’s claims on non-residents in 2021. 
12 In January 2022, non-euro area residents reduced their  deposits parked at the Bundesbank significantly again. 13 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2020, 2019, 2017a, 2017b,  2016).

Reserve assets  rose primarily  due to large  allocation of  special drawing  rights 
liabilities to non-residents also rose steeply as  they took out more loans –  especially short term loans – from overseas. By contrast, trans actions by general government gave rise to net  capital imports of around €4 billion. 
Reserve assets 
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose by €32  billion in 2021 on account of transactions. Of  this, €31 billion was accounted for by its share  of new special drawing rights allocated by the  IMF,15 which, in August 2021, had decided  upon and implemented a large allocation of  special drawing rights to its member coun 
tries.16 Special drawing rights simultaneously  constitute a liability and an asset on the Bun
